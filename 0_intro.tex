The availability of high-density low-cost silicon probes has allowed experimental neuroscientists to record brain-wide maps of neural activity \citep{jun2017fully}. 


Despite these advances, the complexity of performing simultaneous multi-probe recordings remains out of reach for most neuroscientists.
