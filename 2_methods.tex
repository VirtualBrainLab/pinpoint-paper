\subsection{Application and Code}

Pinpoint is available as a website and a standalone application. New releases can be found on the \href{https://github.com/VirtualBrainLab/Pinpoint/releases}{release page} on Github. Documentation and tutorials can be found on our \href{https://virtualbrainlab.org/02_traj_planner/01_tp_intro.html}{main website}.
